**Build dreams. Share resources. Make a difference.**

**OpenContribute** is a project that connects:

- People who have a vision that serves a common cause but lack the resources to succeed.
- People who want to support common cause projects ‚Äî personally, materially, financially, or otherwise ‚Äî and have resources they are willing to share, lend, give, or dedicate.

This platform brings them together.
